Bugs: (description, (d) est. difficulty fixing(1-10), (i) importance(1-10))

Bounding box for an entity should really be a list of bounding boxes. Phased bool in the ICollidable interface should be replaced with something decent.
Difficulty 5

All bounding boxes are not removed when entering a LoadRegion.
Difficulty 4.

::issue 93934::
When finishing an action the current action is reset to move. However this isn't always desirable. Need to think further on how we want this to be handled.

Fireball placement icon is not rotated as it is being placed.

Improvement points:

Really need to improve our Movement in GameActinoLambdas. First of all, the code is duplicated for a move and move away(instead of just having +GameCoordinate or -GameCoordinate).
Second of all, this is the place where a units direction is set, which might be OK, but later on some spells might want to set a new direction and all these would need to calculate which direction.

Wait until actionstatus of unit is finished before fight begins. This should prevent hooks of being cancelled when hooking unit as fight starts.
