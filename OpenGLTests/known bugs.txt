Burrower doesnt teleport every burrow. (only every second.)
Not sure why this is but dont think it might be hard to trace down on.
Difficulty 4
Additionally, the hacks to get the burrower to do stuff is severe. Maybe need to find a more flexible way of doing stuff depending on animation frame.
Difficulty 6

While we render and remove/add stuff which are to be rendered we are manipulating the drawable repo. This means that while we iterate through the drawables there might be an exception.

The current solution seems to work but it's probably causing a severe overhead. In effect, this means that this issue is important, but not urgent.
Difficulty 8

I believe game starts to lag after a while, but im not sure. Will need to investigate
Difficulty 2-10

Bounding box for an entity should really be a list of bounding boxes. Phased bool in the ICollidable interface should be replaced with something decent.
Difficulty 5

Game runs faster when there are fewer entities on the board. This probably has to do with the way we use a static int to do things in each step.
Difficulty 4.

All bounding boxes are not removed when entering a LoadRegion.
Difficulty 4.

If hero aggros 2 units and kills the one who will have action after hero, the second aggrod unit will not perform action and game will be stuck.

We getting duplicated messages in console sometimes. Such as FanBoy died Fanboy died. Somethings fishy. Not really that important since it's not very important. But pretty time consuming to find.

Out of combat I want to be able to make a new move while im doing another move. SO I want to be able to cancel the current move.
