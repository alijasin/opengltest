(description, est. difficulty fixing(1-10))

After exiting aggro range the hero leaves combat even though the aggro unit is still alive.  
Additionally, after exiting the aggro range the queued attacks are cleared which is not desirable.
Two bugs, but one solution: don't leave combat until the aggro'd creature is dead(or outside some certain wider range).

Burrower doesnt teleport every burrow. (only every second.)
Not sure why this is but dont think it might be hard to trace down on.
Difficulty 4
Additionally, the hacks to get the burrower to do stuff is severe. Maybe need to find a more flexible way of doing stuff depending on animation frame.
Difficulty 6

While we render and remove/add stuff which are to be rendered we are manipulating the drawable repo. This means that while we iterate through the drawables there might be an exception.

The current solution seems to work but it's probably causing a severe overhead. In effect, this means that this issue is important, but not urgent.
Difficulty 8

I believe game starts to lag after a while, but im not sure. Will need to investigate
Difficulty 2-10

Bounding box for an entity should really be a list of bounding boxes. Phased bool in the ICollidable interface should be replaced with something decent.
