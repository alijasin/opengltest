Burrower doesnt teleport every burrow. (only every second.)
Not sure why this is but dont think it might be hard to trace down on.
Difficulty 4

Bounding box for an entity should really be a list of bounding boxes. Phased bool in the ICollidable interface should be replaced with something decent.
Difficulty 5

All bounding boxes are not removed when entering a LoadRegion.
Difficulty 4.

Hero can place actions while not its turn. This will cost the hero action points but move will not execute.
d4i8

When finishing an action the current action is reset to move. However this isn't always desirable. Need to think further on how we want this to be handled.
d3i4

Fireball does not end on hit sometimes.
