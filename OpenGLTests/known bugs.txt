(description, est. difficulty fixing(1-10))

After exiting aggro range the hero leaves combat even though the aggro unit is still alive.  
Additionally, after exiting the aggro range the queued attacks are cleared which is not desirable.
Two bugs, but one solution: don't leave combat until the aggro'd creature is dead(or outside some certain range).
Difficulty: 6

Burrower doesnt teleport every burrow. (only every second.)
Not sure why this is but dont think it might be hard to trace down on.
Difficulty 4
Additionally, the hacks to get the burrower to do stuff is severe. Need to find a more flexible way of doing stuff depending on animation frame.
Difficulty 6
