Bugs: (description, (d) est. difficulty fixing(1-10), (i) importance(1-10))

Burrower doesnt teleport every burrow. (only every second.)
Not sure why this is but dont think it might be hard to trace down on.
Difficulty 4

Bounding box for an entity should really be a list of bounding boxes. Phased bool in the ICollidable interface should be replaced with something decent.
Difficulty 5

All bounding boxes are not removed when entering a LoadRegion.
Difficulty 4.

If hero aggros 2 units and kills the one who will have action after hero, the second aggrod unit will not perform action and game will be stuck.
d4i8

Hero can place actions while not its turn. This will cost the hero action points but move will not execute.
d4i8

When finishing an action the current action is reset to move. However this isn't always desirable. Need to think further on how we want this to be handled.
d3i4

Fireball does not end on hit sometimes.
d4i5

Fireball placement icon is not rotated as it is being placed.
d4i1

Improvement points:

Really need to improve our Movement in GameActinoLambdas. First of all, the code is duplicated for a move and move away(instead of just having +GameCoordinate or -GameCoordinate).
Second of all, this is the place where a units direction is set, which might be OK, but thats not it. Third of all, it does the collision checking here. 
That means, for each entity that is moving, all entities will be checked whether they are collided with, every step. Yeah..
Instead we move collision check and do a O(N^2) at the end of gamestep.
